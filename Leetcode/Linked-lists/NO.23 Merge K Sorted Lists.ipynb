    "## Talk about the `type hints` and the `typing` module\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints are a feature in Python that allow us to explicitly specify the expected type of variables, function parameters, and return values. They were introduced to make Python code more understandable and maintainable, although they don't enforce type checking during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Any\n",
    "\n",
    "# For variables\n",
    "x: int = 42\n",
    "name: str = \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# For function parameters and return values\n",
    "def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# For lists, tuples, and dictionaries\n",
    "my_list: List[int] = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_tuple: Tuple[int, str] = (1, \"hello\")\n",
    "my_dict: Dict[str, int] = {\"Alice\": 25, \"Bob\": 30}\n",
    "\n",
    "# For optional types (can also be None)\n",
    "age: Optional[int] = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# For a variable that can be any type\n",
    "something: Any = \"I can be anything\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Type hints make our code more readable. When we or others read the code in the future, it's easier to understand what each function does and what types of values it expects and returns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Editor Support**: Modern code editors use type hints for better code suggestions and error warnings. This improves the development experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Type Checking**: Although Python is dynamically typed, we can use external tools like `mypy` to perform static type checking based on our type hints. This can catch potential bugs before runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Type hints can serve as a form of documentation that's directly integrated into your code, reducing the need for separate comments explaining the types of variables or the expected types of function parameters and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional and Union\n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify that a variable can be of more than one type using `Union`, or that it can also be `None` using `Optional`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Union, Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "def process(value: Union[int, str]) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    # The argument `value` should be either an `int` or a `str`\n",
    "    if isinstance(value, int):\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    elif isinstance(value, str):\n",
    "        return value.upper()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a complex type that we use frequently, we can create a type alias for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector = List[float]\n",
    "Point = Tuple[int, int]\n",
    "\n",
    "def magnitude(v: Vector) -> float:\n",
    "    return sum(x*x for x in v) ** 0.5\n",
    "```"

    "## The logic of the code snippet below\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Build the merged list\n",
    "        while heap:\n",
    "            val, i = heapq.heappop(heap)\n",
    "            current.next = ListNode(val)\n",
    "            current = current.next\n",
    "\n",
    "            if lists[i].next:\n",
    "                lists[i] = lists[i].next\n",
    "                heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Maintain a min-heap*** to keep track of the smallest elements from each of the k sorted linked-lists.\n",
    "2. Iteratively ***pop*** the smallest element from **the heap** and ***append*** it to **a new, sorted linked-list**.\n",
    "3. If the popped element has a successor in its original linked-list, ***insert*** this next element into the heap.\n",
    "4. ***Continue*** this process until the heap is empty.\n",
    "5. The end result is a fully merged, sorted linked-list."

    "## About the `return` in the end\n",
    "\n",
    "In linked list operations, it's common to return a pointer (or a reference in languages that use references) to the head node of the list. The head node serves as ***the entry point*** to traverse the entire list. When we have a pointer to the head node, we essentially have access to ***the whole list*** because you can navigate through it starting from the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original code, `dummy` is a placeholder node and `dummy.next` points to the head of the new merged, sorted linked-list. By returning `dummy.next`, we're giving access to the entire merged list, starting from its head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the function returns a pointer to the head node (`dummy.next`), rather than the list itself or some other structure. It's a common practice in linked list algorithms to represent the list through its head node."
