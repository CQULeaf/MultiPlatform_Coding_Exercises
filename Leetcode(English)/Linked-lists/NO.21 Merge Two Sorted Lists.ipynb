    "### Introduction to `Optional`\n",
    "In type hinting, `Optional` is used to indicate that a variable can have either a specific type or be `None`. This is helpful in indicating what kind of values a function expects or returns, which can make the code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(x: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `x` can be either an integer (`int`) or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely, let's dive deeper into the concept of `Optional`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use `Optional`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `Optional` in type annotations to specify that a variable could be either of a specific type or `None`. The syntax is `Optional[Type]`, where `Type` can be any data type like `int`, `str`, or even custom classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name: Optional[str] = None):\n",
    "    if name:\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `greet` function expects a `name` argument that can either be a string (`str`) or `None`. If you pass a name (string), it greets the name; otherwise, it greets the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Class Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use `Optional` in class attribute definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name: str, age: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `age` attribute could either be an integer or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Omitting the `= None` is OK?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, omitting the `= None` in the type hint is also valid, but it changes the implication slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With `= None`:** When you use `Optional[int] = None`, you're not just saying that the variable can be an `int` or `None`, but you're also providing a default value of `None`. This means if the argument is not provided when calling the function, it will default to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def example_function(value: Optional[int] = None):\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "  \n",
    "  example_function()  # This is valid and `value` will be `None`\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without `= None`:** When you only use `Optional[int]`, it means the variable can either be an `int` or `None`, but you're not providing a default value. This means the argument must be provided explicitly when calling the function, although it can be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def example_function(value: Optional[int]):\n",
    "      pass\n",
    "  \n",
    "  example_function()  # This would be an error because `value` is not provided\n",
    "  example_function(None)  # This is valid\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, including `= None` makes the argument optional when calling the function, whereas just using `Optional[int]` requires the caller to explicitly provide an argument, although the provided argument can be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is `Optional` Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Explanatory Code**: Type hints make it clear what type of value a function expects or returns. When you see `Optional[int]`, you immediately know that the function can handle both integers and `None`. This makes it easier for you, or someone else, to understand the function's behavior just by looking at its signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Prevention**: Knowing that a variable can be `None` reminds you to write code that handles this case, reducing the likelihood of `NoneType` errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Easier Maintenance**: With type hints, the next person who reads your code (which could be future you) will find it easier to understand what the function is supposed to do, making the code easier to maintain and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Editor Support**: Modern IDEs can read type hints and provide better autocompletion and error checking, improving your productivity."

    "### Several questions for this part\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why build a class called `ListNode`?**  \n",
    "   This class serves as a blueprint for creating nodes in a singly-linked list. Using a class allows you to ***create multiple instances***, each representing a node in the list. This way, you can create and manipulate linked lists easily in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why the function name is `__init__`?**  \n",
    "   The `__init__` function is a special method in Python known as a constructor. It's ***automatically called*** when you create a new instance of a class. The double underscores (`__`) before and after the name ***signify that it's a special method recognized by Python***.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why use `self` as a parameter and why `next = None`?**  \n",
    "   - `self`: It refers to the instance of the class. It's used so you can ***access the attributes and methods within the class***.\n",
    "   - `next = None`: Providing a default value of `None` allows you to create a `ListNode` ***without explicitly specifying the next node***. This makes sense for the last node in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why write `self.val = val` and `self.next = next`?**  \n",
    "   These lines are storing the passed-in `val` and `next` arguments into the instance of the class. This way, you can ***reuse these stored values throughout the object's lifetime***.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **If not written, what will happen?**  \n",
    "   If these lines are omitted, the constructor would not store `val` and `next` in the instance. That would mean the object ***wouldn't hold any useful information*** and you wouldn't be able to form linked lists effectively."
