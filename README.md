# Coding Exercises in All Platforms

Welcome to the `Coding-Exercises-in-All-Platforms` repository where I document my coding journey across various programming challenge sites such as Codeforces, Luogu, and more (except Leetcode because it has been created solely before). This collection is a testament to my dedication and commitment to honing my problem-solving skills, offering a glimpse into the breadth and depth of challenges I've tackled.

As you navigate through, you'll find exercises spanning a range of difficulties and topics, each accompanied by my solutions. It's been a rewarding experience, and I invite you to delve in, explore, and perhaps even find inspiration for your own coding journey.

Feedback and insights are always appreciated. Whether you're a fellow coder wanting to discuss a specific solution or someone curious about the world of coding challenges, I'd love to hear from you. Thank you for stopping by, and happy coding!
